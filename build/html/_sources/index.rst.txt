Welcome to SWE-Skat's documentation!
====================================

This is my little Petproject in which I programmed the card game Skat.
The program itself is usable, but does not contain all game elements.
So it is for example not yet possible to make a zero game.
The goal of this project was not to program a perfect Skat, but to try out many different tools and paradigms around programming.


The game is written in pure Python and does not need any other libraries to run it. 
It can be started inside the root folder with the command python main.py.


In the next chapters you will find all points concerning the individual paradigms/tools.

All in all I found this project very useful, because I could try out many different things around programming. 
I found a lot of problems that I always made myself and new ways to improve the code.
If I had to do this project again I would probably do the whole project in a test-driven approach.
