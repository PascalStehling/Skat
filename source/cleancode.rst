Clean Code
==========

In this project I tried to keep the code as clean as possible and as easy to understand as possible. 
Therefore the code was refactored and rewritten very often which can be seen in the log of Github.

To show some examples of clean code we take a closer look at Bidding.py 

* All methods and variables have a meaningful name there, which describes what the method/variable is for.
* All methods are as short as possible
* Each method performs only one task
* There are no code duplications (DRY)
* Since all functions are very short and only perform one task, they are very easy to read and understand. (KISS)


The Clean Code Cheat Sheet can be found in the Root Folder. Its the PDF with the name CleanCodeCheatSheet.pdf.
