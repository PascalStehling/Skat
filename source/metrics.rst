Metrics
=======

In this project 2 different software solutions were used to create different metrics.

The first tool used was **SonarCloud**, which is the cloud solution of **SonarQube**. 
The dashboard can be found at https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=PascalStehling_Skat Metrics that were especially important is:

* *Duplications*: Percentage of all rows, how many of them are duplicates
* *Coverage*: percentage of how many lines of code are covered by tests.
Other metrics are also created by **SonarQube**, such as *security*, *reliability* and *maintainability*. 

As second tool **Codacy** was used. This is also an online solution that can be easily linked to github accounts. 
The setup and usage is more user-friendly than **SonarQube**. 
The dashboard can be accessed via https://app.codacy.com/manual/PascalStehling/Skat/dashboard. 
**Codacy** can also calculate the metrics *Duplications* and *Coverage*. 
But there are also other metrics like *percentage of errors in code* and *percentage of complex files*.

All in all, I think **Codacy** is better than **SonarQube** because it is easier to get started and settings can be made more easily via the website.
